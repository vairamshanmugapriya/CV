  <ul>
	<li><h3><strong>Design of Wearable Cardiac Monitoring System</strong></h3>
	<h4>Discription:</h4>	
    <p>The main aim of this project is to monitor the heartbeat by using a heartbeat sensor to detect a
    heart attack. The person whose heart is to be monitored has a transmitter of Bluetooth module
    and the receiver will be in the doctor room in the form of a smartphone or a computer. The user
    may set the value high as well as low levels of the heartbeat limit. After setting these limits, the
    system starts monitoring and as soon as the patient heartbeat goes above a certain limit, the
    system sends an alert to the Arduino which then transmits this over Bluetooth and alerts the
    doctors as well as concerned users. Also, the system alerts for lower heartbeats.</p>
  <strong>Hardware</strong>: Arduino UNO, heartbeat sensor, Bluetooth module, Buzzer, LED lights.
  </li>
  <li><h3><strong>Development of Smart Inhaler for Pulmonary Disease</strong></h3>
  <h4>Discription:</h4>
  <p>Developed a medicine remainder circuit, this allows the user to set alarm according to their
  dosage time. Detected the level of medication in the canister by using a load cell technique.
  Checked whether the patient take their puff of medication using a touch sensor (Piezo) and the
  time at which the patient took their medicine. The level of medication is sensed to alert the
  patient through a message about the quantity of medication in the canister and insist them to
  buy a new medicine using a GSM module.</p>
  <strong>Hardware</strong>: Arduino UNO, Touch sensor, real time clock, Load cell sensor, GSM module, Amplifier, LED,LCD.
